# SWARMER (working title)

### Overview
Swarmer is a website that is designed for people wanting to interact with others in groups they create based on their interests.

### Hives
After signing up, users may create groups known as "Hives" and allow others to join these hives. Joining a hive is easily done by clicking the join button on the hive's homepage. Leaving is just as easy!

### Posts
Once a user has joined a hive, they may create a post within that hive. Naturally, we can't have chaos, so posts will need to meet the rules set by the monitors of the hive or they will risk being removed.

### Scoring System
Rather than rely on a straightforward scoring approach (whatever has the most upotes/likes will float to the top), Swarmer uses a carefully weighted system that relies on interaction.

If there's one thing I know, it's that people just love arguing with strangers on the internet. In Swarmer, these heated discussions will naturally float to the top. This is achieved by starting with a star-based system, similar to a review score on an online shopping website. Next comes the quantity of reviews. Finally, comes the amount of replies to the post/comment.

Here is an example:

* a comment with an average of 4 stars and 4 ratings
 vs
* a comment with an average of 3 stars and 6 ratings

The comment with 3 stars will outrank the comment with 4 stars based on Swarmer's weighting system and that comment will be the first a user sees as they scroll down the page. Obviously, that comment evoked a stronger response because 6 individual users went out of their way to rate it.

However, once replies are thrown into the mix, that can change! Here's the same situation, but with replies added:

* a comment with an average of 4 stars - 4 ratings - 1 reply
 vs
* a comment with an average of 3 stars - 6 ratings - 0 replies

In this case, the comment with 1 reply would outrank the comment with 0 replies. If the comment was strong enough to evoke an actual written response from a user, then it must be of some significance to the topic at hand.

Naturally, the weighting system will not appeal to all, so I am considering giving different weight options to the montiors of each hive so that they may create a group that works in whichever way they see fit.

### Private Messaging
Users are able to send private messages back and forth to each other once they initiate a conversation with the user of their choice. Currently, this can only be done by manually entering the url of websiteurl/users/<usernameHERE>. This will be improved shortly so that users can visit other's profiles simply by clicking their username wherever it may appear.

### Notifications
Users currently receive notifications for the following actions:

* when someone comments on their post
* when someone replies to their comment on a post
* when someone sends them a private message

Users may clear notifications by clicking the clear button or by clicking directly on the notification, which will then take them to the subject of the notification (i.e., the comment replies section of a comment)
